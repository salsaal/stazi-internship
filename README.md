This poject is built using vite + React first clone the repo then run the following: npm install npm run dev the link to the app will be given in the terminal and it can be accessed from there. all the functionalities which were mentioned in the pdf are there along with the ui which i tried my best to clone from the pdf file. i did only the assignment 1 as i was confused whether to do both or only 1 of it. i would have done both but both are similar and i saw the tasks near the deadline thats why done only the first one. looking forward to a positive response from your end and hoping to work and grow together along side Stazi Technologies. Thankyou Salsaal Shahid
